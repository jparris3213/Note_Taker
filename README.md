# Note_Taker

## Description
  This app is designed to be a simple note taking application and is currently deployed at:

  https://notetaker-jdp.herokuapp.com/

  There isn't a whole lot to add to this description as it is a very basic application using a RESTful API to handle creation/viewing of various notes. Though I would like to add a Delete function as was described in the "bonus" section of the assignment related to this.

          This should then show in your command line a link to your localhost with a port of 3001 (default)
  ## Usage
          Application usage is pretty simple, write a note, click the save icon, and have a list of notes appear to the left of the note writing area.
